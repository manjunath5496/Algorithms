<p>In&nbsp;<a title="Mathematics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Computer science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, an&nbsp;<strong>algorithm</strong>&nbsp;is a finite sequence of&nbsp;<a title="Well-defined" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined">well-defined</a>, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.&nbsp;Algorithms are always&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Unambiguous" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous">unambiguous</a>&nbsp;and are used as specifications for performing&nbsp;<a title="Calculation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation">calculations</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Data processing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing">data processing</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Automated reasoning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning">automated reasoning</a>, and other tasks.</p>
<p>As an&nbsp;<a title="Effective method" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method">effective method</a>, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time,&nbsp;and in a well-defined formal language&nbsp;for calculating a&nbsp;<a title="Function (mathematics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">function</a>.&nbsp;Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps&nbsp;<a title="Empty string" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string">empty</a>),&nbsp;the instructions describe a&nbsp;<a title="Computation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation">computation</a>&nbsp;that, when&nbsp;<a title="Execution (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)">executed</a>, proceeds through a finite&nbsp;number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&nbsp;and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Deterministic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic">deterministic</a>; some algorithms, known as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Randomized algorithms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithms">randomized algorithms</a>, incorporate random input.</p>
<p>The concept of algorithm has existed since antiquity.&nbsp;<a title="Arithmetic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic">Arithmetic</a>&nbsp;algorithms, such as a&nbsp;<a title="Division algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm">division algorithm</a>, was used by ancient&nbsp;<a title="Babylonian mathematics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics">Babylonian mathematicians</a>&nbsp;c. 2500 BC and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Egyptian mathematics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_mathematics">Egyptian mathematicians</a>&nbsp;c. 1550 BC.&nbsp;<a title="Greek mathematics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics">Greek mathematicians</a>&nbsp;later used algorithms in the&nbsp;<a title="Sieve of Eratosthenes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">sieve of Eratosthenes</a>&nbsp;for finding prime numbers,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a title="Euclidean algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a>&nbsp;for finding the&nbsp;<a title="Greatest common divisor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">greatest common divisor</a>&nbsp;of two numbers.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Arabic mathematics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_mathematics">Arabic mathematicians</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a title="Al-Kindi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi">Al-Kindi</a>&nbsp;in the 9th century used&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Cryptographic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic">cryptographic</a>&nbsp;algorithms for&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Code-breaking" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-breaking">code-breaking</a>, based on&nbsp;<a title="Frequency analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis">frequency analysis</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="Etymology" class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>The word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of Persian mathematician&nbsp;<a title="Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</a>&nbsp;in the first steps to&nbsp;<em>algorismus</em>.&nbsp;Al-Khwārizmī (<a title="Persian language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language">Persian</a>:&nbsp;<span dir="rtl" lang="fa">خوارزمی</span>&lrm;, c. 780&ndash;850) was a Persian mathematician,&nbsp;<a title="Astronomer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer">astronomer</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Geographer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographer">geographer</a>, and scholar in the&nbsp;<a title="House of Wisdom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a title="Baghdad" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad">Baghdad</a>,&nbsp;whose name means 'the native of&nbsp;<a title="Khwarazm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarazm">Khwarazm</a>', a region that was part of&nbsp;<a title="Greater Iran" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran">Greater Iran</a>&nbsp;and is now in&nbsp;<a title="Uzbekistan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>.</p>
<p>About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Arabic language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language">Arabic language</a>&nbsp;treatise on the&nbsp;<a title="Hindu&ndash;Arabic numeral system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system">Hindu&ndash;Arabic numeral system</a>, which was translated into&nbsp;<a title="Latin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a>&nbsp;during the 12th century under the title&nbsp;<em>Algoritmi de numero Indorum</em>. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's&nbsp;<a title="Latinisation of names" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names">Latinization</a>&nbsp;of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&nbsp;Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Al-Jabr" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jabr">Algebra</a>. In late medieval Latin,&nbsp;<em>algorismus</em>, English '<a title="Algorism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorism">algorism</a>', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system".&nbsp;In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀ&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;ό&sigmaf; 'number' (<em>cf.</em>&nbsp;'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to&nbsp;<em>algorithmus</em>, and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.</p>
<p>In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by&nbsp;<a title="Geoffrey Chaucer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer</a>&nbsp;in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.</p>
<p>Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled&nbsp;<em>Carmen de Algorismo</em>&nbsp;composed by&nbsp;<a title="Alexander of Villedieu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_of_Villedieu">Alexandre de Villedieu</a>. It begins with:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p><em>Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which translates to:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.</p>
<h2><span id="Informal_definition" class="mw-headline">Informal definition</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">For a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of "algorithm", see&nbsp;<a title="Algorithm characterizations" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_characterizations">Algorithm characterizations</a>.</div>
<p>An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations",&nbsp;which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations, and (for example) any prescribed&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Bureaucratic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic">bureaucratic</a>&nbsp;procedure.&nbsp;In general, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.</p>
<p>A prototypical example of an algorithm is the&nbsp;<a title="Euclidean algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</a>, which is used to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the&nbsp;<a title="Flowchart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart">flowchart</a>&nbsp;above and as an example in a later section.</p>
<p><a href="#CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999">Boolos, Jeffrey &amp; 1974, 1999</a>&nbsp;offer an informal meaning of the word "algorithm" in the following quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough&dagger; ( &dagger;"smaller and smaller without limit &hellip; you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give&nbsp;<em>explicit instructions for determining the&nbsp;<strong>n</strong>th member of the set</em>, for arbitrary finite&nbsp;<em>n</em>. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which&nbsp;<em>they could be followed by a computing machine</em>, or by a&nbsp;<em>human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An "<a title="Recursively enumerable set" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_set">enumerably infinite set</a>" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an&nbsp;<em>arbitrary</em>&nbsp;"input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. For example, an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as&nbsp;<em>y = m + n</em>&nbsp;(i.e., two arbitrary "input variables"&nbsp;<em>m</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;that produce an output&nbsp;<em>y</em>), but various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Precise instructions (in language understood by "the computer")&nbsp;for a fast, efficient, "good"&nbsp;process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&nbsp;to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols&nbsp;<em>m</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>n</em>, symbols&nbsp;<em>+</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>=</em>&nbsp;&hellip; and "effectively"&nbsp;produce, in a "reasonable" time,&nbsp;output-integer&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;at a specified place and in a specified format.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The concept of&nbsp;<em>algorithm</em>&nbsp;is also used to define the notion of&nbsp;<a title="Decidability (logic)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)">decidability</a>&mdash;a notion that is central for explaining how&nbsp;<a title="Formal system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system">formal systems</a>&nbsp;come into being starting from a small set of&nbsp;<a title="Axiom" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axioms</a>&nbsp;and rules. In&nbsp;<a title="Logic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a>, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to the customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of&nbsp;<em>algorithm</em>&nbsp;that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.</p>
<h2><span id="Formalization" class="mw-headline">Formalization</span></h2>
<p>Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform&mdash;in a specific order&mdash;to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a&nbsp;<a title="Turing reduction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction">Turing-complete</a>&nbsp;system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing &hellip; that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments &hellip; in its favor are hard to refute".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gurevich: &ldquo;&hellip; Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine &hellip; according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turing machines can define computational processes that do not terminate. The informal definitions of algorithms generally require that the algorithm always terminates. This requirement renders the task of deciding whether a formal procedure is an algorithm impossible in the general case&mdash;due to a major theorem of&nbsp;<a title="Computability theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">computability theory</a>&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;<a title="Halting problem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting problem</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more&nbsp;<a title="Data structure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">data structures</a>.</p>
<p>For some of these computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. This means that any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).</p>
<p>Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom"&mdash;an idea that is described more formally by&nbsp;<em><a title="Control flow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">flow of control</a></em>.</p>
<p>So far, the discussion on the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of&nbsp;<a title="Imperative programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">imperative programming</a>. This is the most common conception&mdash;one which attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Assignment operation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_operation">assignment operation</a>, which sets the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "<a title="Memory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory">memory</a>" as a scratchpad. An example of such an assignment can be found below.</p>
<p>For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm, see&nbsp;<a title="Functional programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Logic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Expressing_algorithms" class="mw-headline">Expressing algorithms</span></h3>
<p>Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including&nbsp;<a title="Natural language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">natural languages</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Pseudocode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Flowchart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart">flowcharts</a>,&nbsp;<a title="DRAKON" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAKON">drakon-charts</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Control table" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_table">control tables</a>&nbsp;(processed by&nbsp;<a title="Interpreter (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreters</a>). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts,&nbsp;<a title="DRAKON" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAKON">drakon-charts</a>&nbsp;and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in the statements based on natural language. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are also often used as a way to define or document algorithms.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given&nbsp;<a title="Turing machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>&nbsp;program as a sequence of machine tables, as flowcharts and&nbsp;<a title="DRAKON" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAKON">drakon-charts</a>&nbsp;, or as a form of rudimentary&nbsp;<a title="Machine code" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Assembly code" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_code">assembly code</a>&nbsp;called "sets of quadruples".</p>
<p>Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description, as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1 High-level description</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;&hellip;prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."</dd>
<dt>2 Implementation description</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;&hellip;prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."</dd>
<dt>3 Formal description</dt>
<dd>Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".</dd>
</dl>
<p>For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see&nbsp;<a title="Algorithm" href="#Examples">Algorithm#Examples</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Design" class="mw-headline">Design</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Algorithm design refers to a method or a mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Operation research" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_research">operation research</a>, such as&nbsp;<a title="Dynamic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Divide and conquer algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm">divide-and-conquer</a>. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,&nbsp;with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of algorithm design lies in the creation of algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its&nbsp;<a title="Big O notation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">Big O</a>.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Computer systems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_systems">computer systems</a>, an algorithm is basically an instance of&nbsp;<a title="Logic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</a>&nbsp;written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce&nbsp;<em>output</em>&nbsp;from given (perhaps null)&nbsp;<em>input</em>. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher&nbsp;<a title="Time complexity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a>) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.</p>
<p><em>"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs&nbsp;</em>: The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in&nbsp;<a title="Donald Knuth" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Knuth</a>&nbsp;and precisely in&nbsp;<a title="Gregory Chaitin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin">Chaitin</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Knuth: " &hellip; we want&nbsp;<em>good</em>&nbsp;algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion &hellip; is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm &hellip;. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Chaitin: " &hellip; a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"&mdash;such a proof would solve the&nbsp;<a title="Halting problem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting problem</a>&nbsp;(ibid).</p>
<p><em>Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm</em>: For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is ... important to distinguish between the notion of&nbsp;<em>algorithm</em>, i.e. procedure and the notion of&nbsp;<em>function computable by algorithm</em>, i.e. mapping yielded by procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)&mdash;an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.</p>
<p><em>Computers (and computors), models of computation</em>: A computer (or human "computor") is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device"&nbsp;that blindly follows its instructions.&nbsp;Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&nbsp;reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable&nbsp;<em>locations</em>, (ii) discrete, indistinguishable&nbsp;<em>counters</em>&nbsp;(iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are&nbsp;<em>effective</em>&nbsp;relative to the capability of the agent.</p>
<p>Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for&nbsp;<a title="Computability" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">Computability</a>".&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Minsky machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_machine">Minsky's machine</a>&nbsp;proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF&ndash;THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three&nbsp;<em>assignment</em>&nbsp;(replacement, substitution)&nbsp;operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L &larr; 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L &larr; L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L &larr; L &minus; 1).&nbsp;Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Turing complete" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing complete</a>&nbsp;with only four general&nbsp;<em>types</em>&nbsp;of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT. However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction " Z &larr; 0 "; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.</p>
<p><em>Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language</em>: Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example".&nbsp;But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can&nbsp;<em>effectively</em>&nbsp;execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.</p>
<p>This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).</p>
<p>But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base&nbsp;<a title="Computational complexity theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">complexity theory</a>&nbsp;on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of&nbsp;<em>simulation</em>&nbsp;enters".&nbsp;When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "<a title="Modular arithmetic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic">modulus</a>" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").</p>
<p><em>Structured programming, canonical structures</em>: Per the&nbsp;<a title="Church&ndash;Turing thesis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church&ndash;Turing thesis</a>, any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Turing complete" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete">Turing complete</a>, and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types&mdash;conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "<a title="Spaghetti code" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a>", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language".&nbsp;Tausworthe augments the three&nbsp;<a title="Structured program theorem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem">B&ouml;hm-Jacopini canonical structures</a>:&nbsp;SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&nbsp;An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Proof of correctness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_correctness">proofs of correctness</a>&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical induction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">mathematical induction</a>.</p>
<p><em>Canonical flowchart symbols</em>: The graphical aide called a&nbsp;<a title="Flowchart" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart">flowchart</a>, offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The B&ouml;hm&ndash;Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description in English prose, as:</p>
<p><em>High-level description:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.</li>
<li>Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.</li>
<li>For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.</li>
<li>When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.</li>
</ol>

The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: "I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7." Heath comments that "The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'."(Heath 1908:300).</div>

<p><a title="Euclid" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid">Euclid</a>'s algorithm to compute the&nbsp;<a title="Greatest common divisor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">greatest common divisor</a>&nbsp;(GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his&nbsp;<em><a title="Euclid's Elements" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements">Elements</a></em>.&nbsp;Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;successively (<em>q</em>&nbsp;times) along longer length&nbsp;<em>l</em>&nbsp;until the remaining portion&nbsp;<em>r</em>&nbsp;is less than the shorter length&nbsp;<em>s</em>.&nbsp;In modern words, remainder&nbsp;<em>r</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>l</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<em>q</em>&times;<em>s</em>,&nbsp;<em>q</em>&nbsp;being the quotient, or remainder&nbsp;<em>r</em>&nbsp;is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.</p>
<p>For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be &ldquo;proper&rdquo;; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (or the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).</p>
<p>Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a&nbsp;<a title="Reductio ad absurdum" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>&nbsp;proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the&nbsp;<em>greatest</em>.&nbsp;While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.</p>

"Inelegant" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a "modulus" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2&ndash;4.

<p>The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;from the remaining length&nbsp;<em>r</em>&nbsp;until&nbsp;<em>r</em>&nbsp;is less than&nbsp;<em>s</em>. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2&ndash;4:</p>

<p><em>How "Elegant" works</em>: In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A &larr; A &minus; B, and a B &le; A loop that computes B &larr; B &minus; A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S (Difference = Minuend &minus; Subtrahend), the minuend can become&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;(the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new&nbsp;<em>r</em>&nbsp;(the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.</p>

<h3><span id="Testing_the_Euclid_algorithms" class="mw-headline">Testing the Euclid algorithms</span></h3>
<p>Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually give some confidence in the core functionality. But tests are not enough. For test cases, one source&nbsp;uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Relatively prime" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relatively_prime">relatively prime</a>&nbsp;numbers 14157 and 5950.</p>
<p>But "exceptional cases"&nbsp;must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if&nbsp;<em>negative</em>&nbsp;numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Domain (mathematics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(mathematics)">domain</a>&nbsp;of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that&nbsp;<a title="Instance (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)">instantiates</a>&nbsp;it) is a&nbsp;<a title="Partial function" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function">partial function</a>&nbsp;rather than a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Total function" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_function">total function</a>. A notable failure due to exceptions is the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Ariane 5 Flight 501" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5_Flight_501">Ariane 5 Flight 501</a>&nbsp;rocket failure (June 4, 1996).</p>
<p><em>Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction</em>: Knuth demonstrates the application of&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical induction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">mathematical induction</a>&nbsp;to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm".&nbsp;Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.</p>
<h3><span id="Measuring_and_improving_the_Euclid_algorithms" class="mw-headline">Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms</span></h3>
<p><em>Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)</em>: With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is&nbsp;<em>faster</em>&nbsp;(it arrives at HALT in fewer steps).&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Algorithm analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_analysis">Algorithm analysis</a>&nbsp;indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs,&nbsp;<em>on average</em>&nbsp;much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.</p>
<p><em>Can the algorithms be improved?</em>: Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"&mdash;that is, it computes the function intended by its author&mdash;then the question becomes, can it be improved?</p>
<p>The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&nbsp;rather, it can only be done&nbsp;<a title="Heuristic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristically</a>; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at&nbsp;<a title="Busy beaver" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy beaver</a>), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of&nbsp;<a title="Inductive reasoning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">inductive reasoning</a>, etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.</p>
<p>The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.</p>
<h2><span id="Algorithmic_analysis" class="mw-headline">Algorithmic analysis</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the&nbsp;<a title="Analysis of algorithms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms">analysis of algorithms</a>&nbsp;to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(<em>n</em>), using the&nbsp;<a title="Big O notation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">big O notation</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of&nbsp;<em>O(1)</em>, if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(<em>n</em>) if it is counted.</p>
<p>Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '<a title="Algorithmic efficiency" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency">effort</a>' than others. For example, a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Binary search" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search">binary search</a>&nbsp;algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for&nbsp;<a title="Lookup table" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table">table lookups</a>&nbsp;on sorted lists or arrays.</p>
<h3><span id="Formal_versus_empirical" class="mw-headline">Formal versus empirical</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Analysis of algorithms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms">analysis, and study of algorithms</a>&nbsp;is a discipline of&nbsp;<a title="Computer science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific&nbsp;<a title="Programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a>&nbsp;or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually&nbsp;<a title="Pseudocode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>&nbsp;is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their&nbsp;<a title="Algorithmic efficiency" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency">algorithmic efficiency</a>&nbsp;is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.</p>
<p>Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance.&nbsp;<a title="Benchmark (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)">Benchmarks</a>&nbsp;may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization. Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.</p>
<h3><span id="Execution_efficiency" class="mw-headline">Execution efficiency</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to&nbsp;<a title="Fast Fourier transform" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a>&nbsp;algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.&nbsp;In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.&nbsp;Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Recursion</dt>
<dd>A&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Recursive algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_algorithm">recursive algorithm</a>&nbsp;is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to&nbsp;<a title="Functional programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Iteration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration">Iterative</a>&nbsp;algorithms use repetitive constructs like&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Program loops" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_loops">loops</a>&nbsp;and sometimes additional data structures like&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Stack (data structure)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)">stacks</a>&nbsp;to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Towers of Hanoi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_Hanoi">towers of Hanoi</a>&nbsp;is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.</dd>
<dt>Logical</dt>
<dd>An algorithm may be viewed as controlled&nbsp;<a title="Deductive reasoning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning">logical deduction</a>. This notion may be expressed as:&nbsp;<em>Algorithm = logic + control</em>.&nbsp;The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the&nbsp;<a title="Logic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a>&nbsp;paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Formal semantics of programming languages" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages">semantics</a>: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.</dd>
<dt>Serial, parallel or distributed</dt>
<dd>Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Algorithm design" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_design">algorithm designed</a>&nbsp;for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to&nbsp;<a title="Parallel algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_algorithm">parallel algorithms</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Distributed algorithms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_algorithms">distributed algorithms</a>. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a&nbsp;<a title="Computer network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer network</a>. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.</dd>
<dt>Deterministic or non-deterministic</dt>
<dd><a title="Deterministic algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm">Deterministic algorithms</a>&nbsp;solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Non-deterministic algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-deterministic_algorithm">non-deterministic algorithms</a>&nbsp;solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Heuristics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristics">heuristics</a>.</dd>
<dt>Exact or approximate</dt>
<dd>While many algorithms reach an exact solution,&nbsp;<a title="Approximation algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm">approximation algorithms</a>&nbsp;seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the&nbsp;<a title="Knapsack problem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">Knapsack problem</a>, where there is a set of given items. Its goal is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that can be carried is no more than some fixed number X. So, the solution must consider weights of items as well as their value.</dd>
<dt><a title="Quantum algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm">Quantum algorithm</a></dt>
<dd>They run on a realistic model of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Quantum computation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computation">quantum computation</a>. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of&nbsp;<a title="Quantum computing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">Quantum computing</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a title="Quantum superposition" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">quantum superposition</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Quantum entanglement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">quantum entanglement</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><span id="By_design_paradigm" class="mw-headline">By design paradigm</span></h3>
<p>Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or&nbsp;<a title="Algorithmic paradigm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_paradigm">paradigm</a>. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="mw-redirect" title="Brute force search" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute_force_search">Brute-force</a>&nbsp;or exhaustive search</dt>
<dd>This is the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Na&iuml;ve algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_algorithm">naive method</a>&nbsp;of trying every possible solution to see which is best.</dd>
<dt>Divide and conquer</dt>
<dd>A&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Divide and conquer algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm">divide and conquer algorithm</a>&nbsp;repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually&nbsp;<a title="Recursion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursively</a>) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Mergesort" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergesort">merge sorting</a>. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a&nbsp;<em>decrease and conquer algorithm</em>, that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of a decrease and conquer algorithm is the&nbsp;<a title="Binary search algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search algorithm</a>.</dd>
<dt>Search and enumeration</dt>
<dd>Many problems (such as playing&nbsp;<a title="Chess" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">chess</a>) can be modeled as problems on&nbsp;<a title="Graph theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graphs</a>. A&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Graph exploration algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_exploration_algorithm">graph exploration algorithm</a>&nbsp;specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes&nbsp;<a title="Search algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm">search algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Branch and bound" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound">branch and bound</a>&nbsp;enumeration and&nbsp;<a title="Backtracking" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>.</dd>
<dt><a title="Randomized algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm">Randomized algorithm</a></dt>
<dd>Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some&nbsp;<a title="Randomness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness">randomness</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>&nbsp;Whether randomized algorithms with&nbsp;<a title="P (complexity)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)">polynomial time complexity</a>&nbsp;can be the fastest algorithms for some problems is an open question known as the&nbsp;<a title="P versus NP problem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P versus NP problem</a>. There are two large classes of such algorithms:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><a title="Monte Carlo algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm">Monte Carlo algorithms</a>&nbsp;return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g.&nbsp;<a title="RP (complexity)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP_(complexity)">RP</a>&nbsp;is the subclass of these that run in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Polynomial time" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_time">polynomial time</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Las Vegas algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_algorithm">Las Vegas algorithms</a>&nbsp;always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-error_Probabilistic_Polynomial_time">ZPP</a>.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt><a title="Reduction (complexity)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)">Reduction of complexity</a></dt>
<dd>This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully)&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Asymptotically optimal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotically_optimal">asymptotically optimal</a>&nbsp;algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose&nbsp;<a title="Computational complexity theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">complexity</a>&nbsp;is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one&nbsp;<a title="Selection algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm">selection algorithm</a>&nbsp;for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as&nbsp;<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Transform and conquer algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_and_conquer_algorithm">transform and conquer</a></em>.</dd>
<dt><a class="mw-redirect" title="Back tracking" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_tracking">Back tracking</a></dt>
<dd>In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><span id="Optimization_problems" class="mw-headline">Optimization problems</span></h3>
<p>For&nbsp;<a title="Optimization problem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem">optimization problems</a>&nbsp;there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a title="Linear programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">Linear programming</a></dt>
<dd>When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular&nbsp;<a title="Simplex algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">simplex algorithm</a>.&nbsp;Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the&nbsp;<a title="Maximum flow problem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem">maximum flow problem</a>&nbsp;for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an&nbsp;<a title="Integer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer">integer</a>&nbsp;then it is classified in&nbsp;<a title="Integer programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">integer programming</a>. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.</dd>
<dt><a title="Dynamic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">Dynamic programming</a></dt>
<dd>When a problem shows&nbsp;<a title="Optimal substructure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure">optimal substructures</a>&mdash;meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems&mdash;and&nbsp;<a title="Overlapping subproblems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_subproblems">overlapping subproblems</a>, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called&nbsp;<em>dynamic programming</em>&nbsp;avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example,&nbsp;<a title="Floyd&ndash;Warshall algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm">Floyd&ndash;Warshall algorithm</a>, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted&nbsp;<a title="Graph (discrete mathematics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>&nbsp;can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and&nbsp;<a title="Memoization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>&nbsp;go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a&nbsp;<a title="Mathematical table" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table">table</a>&nbsp;of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.</dd>
<dt>The greedy method</dt>
<dd>A&nbsp;<a title="Greedy algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy algorithm</a>&nbsp;is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at&nbsp;<a title="Local optimum" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_optimum">local optima</a>, that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method.&nbsp;<a title="Huffman coding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman Tree</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Kruskal's algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm">Kruskal</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Prim's algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm">Prim</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sollin's algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sollin%27s_algorithm">Sollin</a>&nbsp;are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.</dd>

These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include&nbsp;<a title="Local search (optimization)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)">local search</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Tabu search" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search">tabu search</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Simulated annealing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Genetic algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>.

<h3><span id="By_field_of_study" class="mw-headline">By field of study</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are&nbsp;<a title="Search algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm">search algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Sorting algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">sorting algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Merge algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_algorithm">merge algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Numerical analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis">numerical algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Graph theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="String algorithms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_algorithms">string algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Computational geometry" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry">computational geometric algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Combinatorial" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial">combinatorial algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Medical algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm">medical algorithms</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Machine learning" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Cryptography" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Data compression" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression">data compression</a>&nbsp;algorithms and&nbsp;<a title="Parsing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsing techniques</a>.</p>
<p>Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.</p>
<h3><span id="By_complexity" class="mw-headline">By complexity</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an&nbsp;<a title="Array data structure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">array</a>&nbsp;element.</li>
<li>Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g.&nbsp;<a title="Binary search algorithm" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search algorithm</a>.</li>
<li>Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.</li>
<li>Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the&nbsp;<a title="Bubble sort" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a>&nbsp;algorithm has quadratic time complexity.</li>
<li>Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g.&nbsp;<a title="Brute-force search" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">Brute-force search</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.</p>
<h2><span id="Continuous_algorithms" class="mw-headline">Continuous algorithms</span></h2>
<p>The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:</p>

<p>Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in&nbsp;<a title="Gottschalk v. Benson" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottschalk_v._Benson">Gottschalk v. Benson</a>). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in&nbsp;<a title="Diamond v. Diehr" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr">Diamond v. Diehr</a>, the application of a simple&nbsp;<a title="Feedback" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback">feedback</a>&nbsp;algorithm to aid in the curing of&nbsp;<a title="Synthetic rubber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_rubber">synthetic rubber</a>&nbsp;was deemed patentable.

<p><a title="Alan Turing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s work&nbsp;preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'".&nbsp;Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we&nbsp;might conjecture that all were influences.</p>
<p>Turing&mdash;his model of computation is now called a&nbsp;<a title="Turing machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>&mdash;begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his "state of mind" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Turing's reduction yields the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The simple operations must therefore include:
<dl>
<dd>"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares</dd>
<dd>"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.</dd>
<dd>"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer."</dd>
</dl>
<p>A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition ... [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to G&ouml;del, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] ... We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability &dagger; with effective calculability ... .
<dl>
<dd>"&dagger; We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that&nbsp;<em>an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer</em>. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one." (Rosser 1939:225&ndash;226)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of &lambda;-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his&nbsp;<em>An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory</em>&nbsp;(1936); (2) Herbrand and G&ouml;del and their use of recursion in particular G&ouml;del's use in his famous paper&nbsp;<em>On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I</em>&nbsp;(1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936&ndash;37) in their mechanism-models of computation.</p>
